## Task 1
Endpoint detection and response (EDR) are a series of tools and applications that monitor devices for an activity that could indicate a threat or security breach. These tools and applications have features that include:
- Auditing a device for common vulnerabilities
- Proactively monitoring a device for suspicious activity such as unauthorised logins, brute-force attacks or privilege escalations
- Visualising complex data
- Recording a device's normal operating behaviour to help with detecting anomalies
