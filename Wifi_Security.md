# The basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it.

## What is Wi-Fi?
Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices such as computers (laptops and desktops), mobile devices (smart phones and wearables), and other equipment (printers and video cameras) to interface with the Internet. 
It allows these devices--and many more--to exchange information with one another, creating a network. Internet connectivity occurs through a wireless router. When you access Wi-Fi, you are connecting to a wireless router that allows your Wi-Fi-compatible devices to interface with the Internet.

## How does Wi-Fi work?
On the technical side, the IEEE 802.11 standard defines the protocols that enable communications with current Wi-Fi-enabled wireless devices, including wireless routers and wireless access points. Wireless access points support different IEEE standards.
Each standard is an amendment that was ratified over time. The standards operate on varying frequencies, deliver different bandwidth, and support different numbers of channels.

## Types of Wi-Fi
1. Personal WiFi
2. Enterprise Wi-Fi

## 1.Personal Wi-Fi
   - Appropriate for most home networks. 
   - When a password is set on a wireless router or an access point, it must be entered by users when connecting to the Wi-Fi network.
   - The wireless access can not be individually or centrally managed. One password applies to all users, and it should be manually changed on all the wireless clients once it’s manually modified on the original wireless router.
   - The password is stored on the wireless clients i.e anyone on the computer can connect to the network and also see the password.
 ## 2.Enterprise Wi-Fi
   - Provides security needed for wireless networks in business environments. 
   - It is more complicated to set up, and offers individualized and centralized control over access to Wi-Fi network. When users try to connect to the network, they need to present their login credentials.
   - This mode supports 802.1x RADIUS authentication and is appropriate in cases where a RADIUS server is deployed. 
   - WPA-Enterprise should only be used when a RADIUS server is connected for client authentication.

## Various types of attack on Wi-Fi
There are several types of attacks that can be carried out against Wi-Fi networks, including:

1. Eavesdropping: This type of attack involves intercepting and monitoring wireless network traffic to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.

2. Spoofing: Spoofing attacks involve the use of fake access points to trick users into connecting to them instead of the legitimate network. This allows attackers to capture network traffic or steal login credentials.

3. Rogue Access Points: Rogue access points are unauthorized wireless access points that are set up to mimic a legitimate Wi-Fi network. These can be used to capture sensitive information or launch other types of attacks.

4. Denial of Service (DoS): DoS attacks aim to disrupt the normal operation of a Wi-Fi network by flooding it with traffic or overwhelming it with requests, making it unusable for legitimate users.

5. Password Attacks: Password attacks involve attempting to crack or guess the Wi-Fi network password, either through brute-force methods or by exploiting weaknesses in the password.

6. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: MITM attacks involve intercepting and altering network traffic between two devices, allowing the attacker to view or modify the data being transmitted.

These are just a few examples of the types of attacks that can be carried out against Wi-Fi networks. Wi-Fi security measures such as encryption, strong passwords, and regular updates can help prevent these attacks and keep networks secure.

## Perform Wi-Fi fingerprinting using Wigile, Inssider, and Kismet.

#### Kismet, inSSIDer, and WiGLE are three different tools that are used for wireless network analysis and monitoring. Here is a brief overview of each tool:
1. Kismet:
Kismet is an open-source wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It is designed to work with any 802.11 wireless network and can be used for packet sniffing, network traffic analysis, and wireless network monitoring. Kismet is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS and supports a variety of wireless network cards.

2. inSSIDer:
inSSIDer is a wireless network scanner that can be used to analyze and troubleshoot Wi-Fi networks. It provides information about wireless networks including signal strength, channel, encryption, and other network parameters. inSSIDer is available for Windows and macOS and can be used with any Wi-Fi network adapter.

3. WiGLE:
WiGLE is a website and a mobile app that allows users to search for and map wireless networks. It collects data from wireless networks and provides information about the location, SSID, and signal strength of nearby Wi-Fi networks. Users can also use WiGLE to upload their own wireless network data and contribute to the database. WiGLE is available for both Android and iOS devices.
In summary, Kismet is more of an intrusion detection system that focuses on monitoring wireless networks for potential security breaches, while inSSIDer and WiGLE are tools for analyzing and troubleshooting Wi-Fi networks.

### Kismet 

`sudo kismet -c wlan0`
 
####  Its a linux tool. A wireless network and device detector, sniffer, wardriving tool, reconnaissance tool and WIDS (wireless intrusion detection) framework. Displays all the information such as bssid,ssid,devices per channel, etc of all the devices in that range.

### Wigle 
- Here we downloanded an application from the playstore and we can see the information and also the geographical location of a particular ip address.

## After capturing the required filesfortesting, usedictionarygeneration and password cracking tools to crack the Wi-Fi password. 
### a.You mustuse an existing word file to crack the password.
### b.Also you have to create your dictionaryfilefor cracking the passwords.
### c.Keep 3 different types of passwordsforyour Wi-Fi to test it. Simple, medium,and complex passwords can be used for testing. Simple can be a dictionary word, medium can be of dictionaryword with some numbers, and complex can be generated from any password generatoronline.

## Learn the protocol level working of WPA3 and how it differsfrom WPA2.
  
  WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) is the latest standard for securing Wi-Fi networks, which was introduced in 2018. It offers several improvements over its predecessor, WPA2, including stronger encryption, enhanced protection against password cracking, and improved security for public Wi-Fi networks.

At the protocol level, WPA3 uses a new key exchange protocol called "Simultaneous Authentication of Equals" (SAE) or Dragonfly, which is more resistant to offline dictionary attacks. Unlike WPA2, which uses the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) method to authenticate users and devices, WPA3 uses a stronger method called "Opportunistic Wireless Encryption" (OWE). This method provides encryption to networks that don't have a password or where the password is shared among many users, such as public Wi-Fi networks.

WPA3 also introduces new encryption algorithms, including 256-bit Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP-256) and 384-bit Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) with Secure Hash Algorithm 384 (SHA-384) for data integrity protection. These encryption algorithms are more secure and efficient than the ones used in WPA2.

Another key feature of WPA3 is Protected Management Frames (PMF), which provides protection against denial-of-service attacks and other wireless network attacks. PMF ensures that management frames are encrypted and authenticated, preventing attackers from spoofing these frames to take control of the network.

In summary, WPA3 offers several improvements over WPA2 at the protocol level, including stronger encryption, improved password protection, and enhanced security for public Wi-Fi networks. It achieves these improvements through the use of a new key exchange protocol, stronger encryption algorithms, and enhanced protection against wireless network attacks.
